1 - extract all the information from the .obj file and put them in the appropriate list/array

2 - order normals and uvs to match the veretx positions

NOTES:
	1 - final uv array is the size of: (vertexPositions.Count / 1.5)
	this is a equation to calculate how many texture coords there has 
	to be for the given number of vertex position knowing that 
	position are composed of xyz and uvs are just xy
	another way the discribe the equation is ((vertexPositions.Count / 1/3) + (veretxPositions.Count /1/3)): one column.count plus one column.count
