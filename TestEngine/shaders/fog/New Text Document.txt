goal: we're going gto mix the vertices colors with the sky color depending on how far the vertex is from the camera

steps:
1 - get veretx position in relation to camera

2 - caclulate veretx distance from camera

3 - define the fog's density and gradient

4 put those variables in an equation to produce a visibility variable

5 pass the visibility variable to the fragment shader

6 - mix the output color with the sky color depending on the visibility variable
