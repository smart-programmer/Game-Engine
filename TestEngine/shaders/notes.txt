what is a texture sampler?:
when we reserved a texture unit for our texture in the application to put our texture in we needed a way to acces that texture in the shader and a sampler is just that a sampler is getting that texture from the texture unit that we put the texture in so we can use the texture in the shader 


for the specular light lighting i think my way of passing the camera position as a uniform is better than calculating it from the viewMatrix because when i changed to calculating it like thinmatrix from ther viewMatrix i noticed some lag sometimes
